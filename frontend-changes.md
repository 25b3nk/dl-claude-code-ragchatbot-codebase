# Frontend Code Quality Tools Implementation

This document outlines the essential code quality tools added to the development workflow for improved code consistency and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Quality Dependencies Added

Updated `pyproject.toml` to include essential development dependencies:

- **black (>=24.0.0)**: Automatic Python code formatter
- **isort (>=5.13.0)**: Import statement organizer 
- **flake8 (>=7.0.0)**: Code linter for style and error checking

### 2. Configuration Setup

Added comprehensive tool configuration in `pyproject.toml`:

#### Black Configuration
- Line length: 88 characters (Python community standard)
- Target Python version: 3.13
- Proper file inclusion patterns
- Common directories excluded from formatting

#### Isort Configuration  
- Profile: "black" (ensures compatibility with black formatter)
- Multi-line output style: 3
- Line length: 88 (matches black)

### 3. Development Scripts

Created executable shell scripts in `scripts/` directory:

#### `scripts/format.sh`
- Automatically formats all Python code using black
- Sorts import statements using isort
- Provides clear progress feedback

#### `scripts/lint.sh`  
- Runs flake8 linting with black-compatible settings
- Checks import formatting without modifying files
- Verifies black formatting compliance
- Returns exit codes for CI/CD integration

#### `scripts/quality.sh`
- Complete quality check pipeline
- Installs dependencies, formats code, runs linting, and executes tests
- One-command solution for pre-commit quality assurance

### 4. Codebase Formatting Applied

- Reformatted 15 Python files using black for consistent style
- Organized import statements across all modules using isort
- Maintained existing functionality while improving readability

## Usage

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Format code
./scripts/format.sh

# Check code quality  
./scripts/lint.sh

# Complete quality check
./scripts/quality.sh
```

### Individual Tools

```bash
# Format specific files
uv run black backend/app.py

# Check imports only
uv run isort --check-only backend/

# Lint specific directory
uv run flake8 backend/ --max-line-length=88
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Uniform code style across the entire codebase
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to read and maintain code
3. **Collaboration**: Reduced style-related code review discussions  
4. **Automation**: Scripts eliminate manual formatting steps
5. **Quality Assurance**: Automated checks catch style issues early

## Integration with Development Workflow

The quality tools are now integrated into the development workflow:

- Developers can run `./scripts/format.sh` before committing
- CI/CD can use `./scripts/lint.sh` to verify code quality
- `./scripts/quality.sh` provides complete pre-commit validation

All tools are configured to work harmoniously together, ensuring a smooth development experience while maintaining high code quality standards.
