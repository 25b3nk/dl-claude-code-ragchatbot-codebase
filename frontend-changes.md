# Frontend Changes - Dark/Light Theme Toggle

This document outlines the changes made to implement the dark/light theme toggle feature for the Course Materials Assistant.

## Overview

Added a theme toggle button that allows users to switch between dark and light themes. The implementation includes:
- Toggle button with sun/moon icons
- CSS custom properties for theme switching
- JavaScript functionality with localStorage persistence
- Smooth transition animations
- Full accessibility support

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/style.css`
- **Added CSS Variables for Light Theme**: Added `[data-theme="light"]` selector with light theme color variables
- **Enhanced Existing Dark Theme**: Updated CSS variables with clear comments
- **Theme Transition Animations**: Added universal transition rule for smooth theme switching
- **Theme Toggle Button Styles**: Added complete styling for the toggle button including:
  - Fixed positioning in top-right corner
  - Hover and focus states
  - Icon visibility logic for light/dark themes
  - Responsive design adjustments
- **Improved Light Theme Support**: Enhanced code block and inline code styling for better visibility in light theme

### 2. `frontend/index.html`
- **Added Theme Toggle Button**: Inserted toggle button with:
  - Sun and moon SVG icons
  - Proper accessibility attributes (`aria-label`)
  - Semantic HTML structure

### 3. `frontend/script.js`
- **Added Theme Management Functions**:
  - `initializeTheme()`: Loads saved theme preference from localStorage
  - `toggleTheme()`: Switches between dark and light themes
  - `setTheme(theme)`: Applies theme by setting/removing `data-theme` attribute
- **Enhanced Event Listeners**: Added click and keyboard navigation support for theme toggle
- **localStorage Integration**: Theme preference persists across browser sessions

## Theme Implementation Details

### CSS Custom Properties
- **Dark Theme (Default)**: Uses existing dark color scheme
- **Light Theme**: New light color scheme with:
  - White background (`#ffffff`)
  - Light surface colors (`#f8fafc`, `#f1f5f9`)
  - Dark text colors (`#1e293b`, `#64748b`)
  - Adjusted shadows and borders for light theme

### JavaScript Theme Logic
- Theme is stored in `localStorage` as 'theme' key
- Default theme is 'dark' if no preference is saved
- Theme switching updates `data-theme` attribute on `<body>` element
- Console logging for debugging theme changes

## Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation
- Toggle button responds to both `Enter` and `Space` keys
- Prevents default behavior to avoid page scrolling

### ARIA Labels
- Theme toggle button includes `aria-label="Toggle theme"` for screen readers

### Focus Management
- CSS focus indicators with visible focus ring
- Smooth hover and active states for better user feedback

### Visual Design
- High contrast maintained in both themes
- Proper color ratios for text readability
- Consistent visual hierarchy across themes

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- Smooth 0.3s transitions for all color-related properties
- Icon changes (sun â†” moon) to indicate current theme
- Hover effects with subtle animations

### Responsive Design
- Toggle button scales appropriately on mobile devices
- Maintains positioning and usability across screen sizes

### Persistence
- Theme preference automatically saved and restored
- Consistent experience across browser sessions

## Browser Compatibility
- Uses modern CSS custom properties (CSS Variables)
- localStorage API for theme persistence
- SVG icons for crisp display at all sizes
- Graceful fallback to dark theme if localStorage unavailable

## Future Enhancements
- Could add system theme detection using `prefers-color-scheme`
- Additional theme variants (high contrast, etc.)
- Animation preferences based on `prefers-reduced-motion`
