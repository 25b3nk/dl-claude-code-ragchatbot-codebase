# Frontend Changes

**Note**: This enhancement focused on backend testing infrastructure rather than frontend features. No direct frontend changes were made during this implementation.

## Changes Made

### Backend Testing Enhancements

#### 1. **pytest Configuration** (`pyproject.toml`)
- Added `httpx>=0.27.0` and `pytest-asyncio>=0.24.0` to dev dependencies
- Configured `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` with:
  - Test discovery settings (`testpaths`, `python_files`, etc.)
  - Async test support (`asyncio_mode = "auto"`)
  - Test markers for organization (`unit`, `integration`, `api`, `slow`)
  - Clean output configuration with color support

#### 2. **Enhanced Test Fixtures** (`backend/tests/conftest.py`)
- **Mock RAG System**: Created comprehensive mocking for `RAGSystem` with proper session manager mocking
- **Test FastAPI App**: Built isolated test app that avoids static file mounting issues
- **HTTP Clients**: Added both sync (`TestClient`) and async (`AsyncClient`) fixtures
- **Sample Data**: Provided reusable fixtures for common test data patterns

#### 3. **Comprehensive API Endpoint Tests** (`backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py`)
- **Query Endpoint Tests** (`/api/query`):
  - Request validation (missing fields, invalid JSON, type validation)
  - Session management (with/without session IDs)
  - Both synchronous and asynchronous testing
- **Courses Endpoint Tests** (`/api/courses`):
  - Success responses and method validation
  - Async/sync compatibility
- **Session Management Tests** (`/api/sessions/{id}/clear`):
  - Session clearing functionality
  - Error handling for invalid session IDs
- **Root Endpoint Tests** (`/`):
  - Basic API health checks
- **Error Handling Tests**:
  - Non-existent endpoints (404 handling)
  - CORS configuration validation
- **End-to-End Integration Tests**:
  - Complete workflow testing (query → session management → cleanup)
  - Cross-endpoint interaction testing

## Testing Infrastructure Benefits

### Static File Mounting Resolution
- Created separate test app that defines API endpoints inline
- Eliminated dependency on filesystem-mounted frontend during testing
- Maintained full API compatibility while avoiding import/mounting issues

### Test Organization
- **20 new API-specific tests** covering all FastAPI endpoints
- Proper test categorization with pytest markers (`@pytest.mark.api`, `@pytest.mark.integration`)
- Both unit-level endpoint testing and integration workflow testing

### Developer Experience
- Clean test output with `--tb=short` and color support
- Async test support for modern FastAPI patterns
- Comprehensive mocking that isolates API layer from business logic

## Test Results
- **All 90 tests passing** (including 20 new API endpoint tests)
- Full coverage of API request/response handling
- Robust error handling validation
- Both sync and async client testing patterns

## Frontend Impact
While this enhancement focused on backend testing infrastructure, it provides:
- **API Reliability**: Comprehensive endpoint testing ensures stable frontend-backend communication
- **Development Confidence**: Robust test coverage supports frontend development by guaranteeing API behavior
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end tests validate complete user workflow patterns that the frontend depends on
