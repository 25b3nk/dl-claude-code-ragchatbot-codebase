## Part 1: Frontend Changes - Dark/Light Theme Toggle

### Overview

Added a theme toggle button that allows users to switch between dark and light themes. The implementation includes:
- Toggle button with sun/moon icons
- CSS custom properties for theme switching
- JavaScript functionality with localStorage persistence
- Smooth transition animations
- Full accessibility support

### Files Modified

#### 1. `frontend/style.css`
- **Added CSS Variables for Light Theme**: Added `[data-theme="light"]` selector with light theme color variables
- **Enhanced Existing Dark Theme**: Updated CSS variables with clear comments
- **Theme Transition Animations**: Added universal transition rule for smooth theme switching
- **Theme Toggle Button Styles**: Added complete styling for the toggle button including:
  - Fixed positioning in top-right corner
  - Hover and focus states
  - Icon visibility logic for light/dark themes
  - Responsive design adjustments
- **Improved Light Theme Support**: Enhanced code block and inline code styling for better visibility in light theme

#### 2. `frontend/index.html`
- **Added Theme Toggle Button**: Inserted toggle button with:
  - Sun and moon SVG icons
  - Proper accessibility attributes (`aria-label`)
  - Semantic HTML structure

#### 3. `frontend/script.js`
- **Added Theme Management Functions**:
  - `initializeTheme()`: Loads saved theme preference from localStorage
  - `toggleTheme()`: Switches between dark and light themes
  - `setTheme(theme)`: Applies theme by setting/removing `data-theme` attribute
- **Enhanced Event Listeners**: Added click and keyboard navigation support for theme toggle
- **localStorage Integration**: Theme preference persists across browser sessions

### Theme Implementation Details

#### CSS Custom Properties
- **Dark Theme (Default)**: Uses existing dark color scheme
- **Light Theme**: New light color scheme with:
  - White background (`#ffffff`)
  - Light surface colors (`#f8fafc`, `#f1f5f9`)
  - Dark text colors (`#1e293b`, `#64748b`)
  - Adjusted shadows and borders for light theme

#### JavaScript Theme Logic
- Theme is stored in `localStorage` as 'theme' key
- Default theme is 'dark' if no preference is saved
- Theme switching updates `data-theme` attribute on `<body>` element
- Console logging for debugging theme changes

### Accessibility Features

#### Keyboard Navigation
- Toggle button responds to both `Enter` and `Space` keys
- Prevents default behavior to avoid page scrolling

#### ARIA Labels
- Theme toggle button includes `aria-label="Toggle theme"` for screen readers

#### Focus Management
- CSS focus indicators with visible focus ring
- Smooth hover and active states for better user feedback

#### Visual Design
- High contrast maintained in both themes
- Proper color ratios for text readability
- Consistent visual hierarchy across themes

### User Experience

#### Visual Feedback
- Smooth 0.3s transitions for all color-related properties
- Icon changes (sun â†” moon) to indicate current theme
- Hover effects with subtle animations

#### Responsive Design
- Toggle button scales appropriately on mobile devices
- Maintains positioning and usability across screen sizes

#### Persistence
- Theme preference automatically saved and restored
- Consistent experience across browser sessions

### Browser Compatibility
- Uses modern CSS custom properties (CSS Variables)
- localStorage API for theme persistence
- SVG icons for crisp display at all sizes
- Graceful fallback to dark theme if localStorage unavailable

### Future Enhancements
- Could add system theme detection using `prefers-color-scheme`
- Additional theme variants (high contrast, etc.)
- Animation preferences based on `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Part 2: Backend Code Quality Tools Implementation

### Overview

This section outlines the essential code quality tools added to the development workflow for improved code consistency and maintainability.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Code Quality Dependencies Added

Updated `pyproject.toml` to include essential development dependencies:

- **black (>=24.0.0)**: Automatic Python code formatter
- **isort (>=5.13.0)**: Import statement organizer 
- **flake8 (>=7.0.0)**: Code linter for style and error checking

#### 2. Configuration Setup

Added comprehensive tool configuration in `pyproject.toml`:

##### Black Configuration
- Line length: 88 characters (Python community standard)
- Target Python version: 3.13
- Proper file inclusion patterns
- Common directories excluded from formatting

##### Isort Configuration  
- Profile: "black" (ensures compatibility with black formatter)
- Multi-line output style: 3
- Line length: 88 (matches black)

#### 3. Development Scripts

Created executable shell scripts in `scripts/` directory:

##### `scripts/format.sh`
- Automatically formats all Python code using black
- Sorts import statements using isort
- Provides clear progress feedback

##### `scripts/lint.sh`  
- Runs flake8 linting with black-compatible settings
- Checks import formatting without modifying files
- Verifies black formatting compliance
- Returns exit codes for CI/CD integration

##### `scripts/quality.sh`
- Complete quality check pipeline
- Installs dependencies, formats code, runs linting, and executes tests
- One-command solution for pre-commit quality assurance

#### 4. Codebase Formatting Applied

- Reformatted 15 Python files using black for consistent style
- Organized import statements across all modules using isort
- Maintained existing functionality while improving readability

### Usage

#### Quick Commands

```bash
# Format code
./scripts/format.sh

# Check code quality  
./scripts/lint.sh

# Complete quality check
./scripts/quality.sh
```

#### Individual Tools

```bash
# Format specific files
uv run black backend/app.py

# Check imports only
uv run isort --check-only backend/

# Lint specific directory
uv run flake8 backend/ --max-line-length=88
```

### Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Uniform code style across the entire codebase
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to read and maintain code
3. **Collaboration**: Reduced style-related code review discussions  
4. **Automation**: Scripts eliminate manual formatting steps
5. **Quality Assurance**: Automated checks catch style issues early

### Integration with Development Workflow

The quality tools are now integrated into the development workflow:

- Developers can run `./scripts/format.sh` before committing
- CI/CD can use `./scripts/lint.sh` to verify code quality
- `./scripts/quality.sh` provides complete pre-commit validation

All tools are configured to work harmoniously together, ensuring a smooth development experience while maintaining high code quality standards.
